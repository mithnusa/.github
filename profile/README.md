# Odoo and Google Maps integration

This organisation focuses on the integration of Google Maps services in Odoo.
The person behind this organisation is the same person who created and maintained the Odoo and Google Maps integration. https://github.com/gityopie/odoo-addons.

All of the Javascript part (view and widget) have been rewritten using the new Odoo Javascript Framework [OWL Framework](https://odoo.github.io/owl/)
